This project studies the effect of policy changes on opioid drug abuse. Observed the prescription opioid shipments for Florida and Washington states and the mortality rates of Florida, Washington, and Texas on a per county per year per capita basis. We also compare their trends against three comparison states each to make causal inferences.
